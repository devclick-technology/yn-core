### Introduction
This package serves the purpose of sharing common code between two projects: "younegotiate backend" (specifically, the "creditor" and "superadmin" components) and "younegotiate frontend" (targeting consumers).

The package comes equipped with a minimal set of Composer packages for basic functionality. To leverage default Laravel features, it is essential to resolve the required Composer package.

### Installation
- Grant GitHub permissions in the Composer authentication.
- Run the following command to install the package:

```base
composer require devclick-technology/yn-core:dev-develop
```
